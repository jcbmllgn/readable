##Readable: Uncluttering (some) websites and blogs##

This simple bookmarklet was made to make reading websites easier. Some blogs and news sites have great content but the page is cluttered with social sharing, headers, footers, sidebars, popups, etc.. Readable removes the distractions and just gives you the content.
